# Contribution workflow

The repository pins just 1.58.0, Node.js 24.18.0, pnpm 11.8.0, Lefthook 2.1.18-buzz.3,
and Rust 1.98.1
(including Cargo, rustfmt, and Clippy) with [Hermit](https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/).
No global tool installation is required: `bin/hermit` bootstraps Hermit and tools
are downloaded on first use. The temporary Lefthook package builds once from
checksum-pinned upstream source plus our worktree-recovery patch using pinned
Go 1.27.0; this first use needs network access for Go modules and takes longer.
The small `bin/lefthook` launcher provisions Go before entering Hermit’s package
unpack lock, then executes the pinned `bin/lefthook-runner`. Desktop development still requires the
[Tauri platform prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/).

From the repository root:

```sh
source bin/activate-hermit # bash/zsh; fish: source bin/activate-hermit.fish
just --list
```

Without activation, use `bin/just`, `bin/pnpm`, or `bin/cargo` from the root;
these proxies supply the pinned environment to child commands too. For example,
`bin/just web` needs no shell setup. With activation, commands also work from
subdirectories, relative to this project's justfile.

`bin/hermit` bootstraps from Hermit's public GitHub release. `bin/hermit.hcl`
selects the [public package catalog](https://github.com/cashapp/hermit-packages)
and does not override npm/pnpm registry or CA settings. Without local overrides,
dependencies use the [public npm registry](https://registry.npmjs.org/).
Existing user configuration such as `~/.npmrc` remains effective; keep any
organization-specific mirror, credentials and trusted CA paths there, not in Git.
No company package infrastructure, registry credentials or custom CA bundle is
required by this repository. Do not disable TLS verification or package integrity
checks. If your network intercepts TLS, configure its trusted CA locally rather
than committing machine-specific paths or disabling certificate verification.
No user-level npm configuration edit, Corepack bootstrap, or temporary
tool PATH is needed for a clean public-registry setup. Commit the `bin/` scripts
and package symlinks; `.hermit/` contains ignored local state.

All tool versions are unchanged by the public-tooling migration. The public
catalog does not yet include Node 24.18.0, so `bin/packages/node.hcl` pins its
[official downloads and checksums](https://nodejs.org/dist/v24.18.0/SHASUMS256.txt)
as a repository-local override. Remove that override when the public catalog
supports the same pin; do not silently downgrade it.

The pinned pnpm Hermit package supports Apple Silicon macOS but marks Intel macOS
(`darwin-amd64`) unsupported. Do not silently substitute a different pnpm version
on an unsupported platform; resolve that tooling gap first. Other platforms still
need their own validation.

- `just web [args...]`: install locked dependencies and forward arguments to Vite,
  e.g. `just web --port 1431 --host 127.0.0.1`. Vite uses the requested port
  (default: derived from the worktree path) or the next available port, allowing
  parallel browser development.
  Use `just web profile` for opt-in Chromium and broker CPU profiles. Profiling
  binds only `127.0.0.1`; wildcard, hostname, and IPv6 `--host` values are rejected
  so the captured page and development broker have one unambiguous owner. Use
  `just web profile --network` to additionally record sanitized browser network
  metadata in `network.json`; payloads, cookies, authorization headers, query strings,
  fragments, and WebSocket frame data are omitted. Use `just web profile --trace`
  to record a Chromium DevTools Performance trace (`chromium-trace.json`, with
  style/layout/paint events, React's performance tracks, and denser CPU samples)
  in place of `chromium-renderer.cpuprofile`; traces are large, so keep traced
  sessions short. Press Ctrl+C to finalize the capture; the command prints the
  `.profiles/...-web` output directory. Load `.cpuprofile` and trace files in
  Chromium DevTools (**Performance** > **Load profile**).
  Use `just web profile --scenario <file>` for an unattended capture. The file
  is any JavaScript module, inside or outside the repository (a relative path
  resolves from the repository root), that default-exports
  `async (page, { signal }) => {}` and drives the Playwright `page`. When it
  returns, the command saves the app's [client metrics](client-metrics.md)
  export as `client-metrics.json` and exits without Ctrl+C. A scenario that
  throws or does not finish within five minutes fails the run: the command
  prints the scenario's stack and the directory holding the remaining
  artifacts, saves no client metrics, and exits nonzero. Ctrl+C during a
  scenario also saves no client metrics but exits zero, like any interrupted
  capture. `signal` aborts on Ctrl+C, at the timeout, and when the capture ends,
  so pass it to any wait that would otherwise outlive the run. A scenario
  outside the repository resolves bare imports from its own location, not from
  the repository's `node_modules`. A scenario runs as your real account, so
  keep it read-only. Every capture starts from a fresh browser profile with no
  community selected unless `BUZZ_DEV_OPEN_RELAY=1` is set. `manifest.json`
  records the scenario file and `relay`, the `https://` origin of the
  `BUZZ_RELAY_URL` that Vite resolves from the environment or its `.env` files;
  a value the dev server would reject is recorded as `null`. To profile in
  another Vite mode, pass it as `--mode <mode>` so the manifest follows it.
- `just desktop [args...]`: install locked dependencies and forward arguments to
  Tauri, e.g. `just desktop --port 1431 --no-watch`. The desktop adapter consumes
  `--port N` or `--port=N` to set both Vite's port and Tauri's development URL;
  Tauri's own `--port` is for its static-file server, not Vite. Without this flag,
  the adapter derives a stable port from the worktree path (the same derivation
  `just web` uses) and prints the chosen URL. Different paths can still collide.
  Ordinary desktop development runs do not claim the OS `buzz` URL scheme or the
  packaged single-instance lock, so multiple worktrees can run at once. Packaged
  and debug bundles still use `buzz`. See [OS deep links](deep-links.md).
  Desktop requires the exact port to be free; an occupied port fails rather than
  opening another copy's server. Other arguments, including runner/application arguments after `--`, pass
  through unchanged. Port configuration is prepended so Tauri parses it even with
  implicit runner arguments. Explicit `--config` arguments merge afterward and can
  override it; keep their development URL and frontend command consistent. Use `--`
  before runner/application arguments if they contain their own `--port` flag.
  On macOS, `just desktop profile` uses Instruments' Time Profiler to launch and
  record only the Buzz native parent process, not every process on the desktop.
  WebKit subprocesses and the Vite broker are outside this native trace; use web
  profiling when renderer/broker CPU coverage is required. Native file watching is
  disabled during capture. Press Ctrl+C to finalize and validate the trace; the
  path, which opens in Instruments. Use `just profile-clean` to remove all generated
  web and desktop captures.
- `just desktop-bundle [args...]`: bundle a debug desktop app for testing OS deep
  links on macOS, where the OS routes a scheme only to a bundled application. It
  defaults to a `.app` bundle unless `--bundles` or `--no-bundle` says otherwise,
  and passes everything else to `tauri build`. The bundle uses `buzz`, as does
  release bundling with `pnpm tauri build`.
- `just design [args...]`: install locked dependencies, start the standalone
  design-system viewer, and open it in your browser. Arguments pass through to
  Vite, e.g. `just design --port 1444`. The default port is 1442; an occupied port
  fails rather than switching automatically. This starts neither Tauri nor the
  live relay broker. Press Ctrl+C to stop it.
- To pause notifications in your local dev server, set `BUZZ_DEV_NOTIFICATIONS=0`
  in `.env.local` and restart the server. Only `0` pauses alerts and permission
  requests; removing the setting restores normal behavior. Saved preferences are
  untouched and production builds ignore the variable.
- To open the default relay's community on a fresh dev port, set
  `BUZZ_DEV_OPEN_RELAY=1` alongside `BUZZ_RELAY_URL` in `.env.local` and restart
  the server. Only `1` enables it; a viewer's existing saved choice on that port,
  including Personal space, wins. Production builds ignore the variable. The OG
  `BUZZ_BUILD_AUTO_CONNECT_DEFAULT_RELAY` name is a **presence-only dev alias**:
  even empty, `0` or `false` enables it when `BUZZ_DEV_OPEN_RELAY` is absent.
  Explicit `BUZZ_DEV_OPEN_RELAY=0` opts out. Neither input provides packaged relay
  connectivity. See [configuration parity](configuration.md).
- `just fullstack`: reserved, exits unsuccessfully with an explanation. It will
  eventually start local Docker services including the Buzz relay backend.
- `just iterate`: install locked dependencies, format Rust, apply Biome safe
  fixes, check TypeScript, and build the frontend. Remaining problems fail the command. No tests or
  native compilation run here.
- `just scan`: install locked dependencies, check formatting/lint/types, build
  the frontend, run Node/Vitest/plugin-manager tests, headless Chromium/WebKit
  journeys, Rust Clippy, and native Rust tests. It does not auto-fix source.
  This is broader validation, not a signed package or a cross-platform test.

Before the first `scan`, install the pinned browser engines with
`bin/pnpm test:browser:install`; missing engines fail rather than skip. Linux native
notification tests also require `dbus-daemon` (installed in CI). They start and stop
isolated test buses, never use the desktop session bus or display real banners. See
[browser regression coverage and measurement limits](browser-testing.md).

Installs run on every invocation to account for branch and lockfile changes.
pnpm reuses its shared package cache; no node_modules directory needs to be copied
into a new worktree. Native dependencies are fetched by Cargo as needed into the
shared `~/.cargo`. Each worktree compiles into its own `target/`, overriding any
user-level `target-dir`, so its app and bundled resources always match its sources;
remove stale worktrees (or run `bin/cargo clean` in them) to reclaim that space.
Native compilation still takes time in each new worktree. Parallel worktrees normally need
no port flags: each derives a stable default from its path. Pass `--port` if paths
collide, the default is occupied, or you run a second instance from one checkout;
ports must be integers from 1 to 65535. Browser dev
prints its selected URL and can use a later port when the requested port is
occupied. Port selection does not isolate credentials or native plugin data;
use the existing `BUZZODZ_PROFILE` setting for separate plugin profiles.
A public `BUZZ_DEV_VIEWER` pin enables the legacy development broker for either
command. Without it, browser development has no live broker identity, while
supported desktop development can use native identity and relay access. See
[host modes below](#shared-logic-and-host-boundaries) and
[the broker setup requirements](../README.md#relay-channels).

After creating a worktree, bootstrap it from the checkout whose local development
configuration it should inherit:

```sh
scripts/bootstrap-worktree.sh /absolute/path/to/source/checkout
```

The idempotent script copies the source checkout's git-ignored `.env.local`
without overwriting an existing target, then uses the new worktree's Hermit proxy
to run `bin/pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`. It rejects checkouts from another
repository. Keychain credentials and pnpm's package cache remain machine-shared;
do not copy private keys, `node_modules`, build output, `.npmrc`, or other ignored
files. Git hooks need no per-worktree step; see [Git hooks](#git-hooks).

### Worktree Dock labels (macOS)

`just desktop` adds the current branch suffix to the Dock icon in linked Git
worktrees (for example, `person/my-feature` shows `my-feature`). Detached
worktrees use the checkout directory name. Restart the desktop command after
switching or renaming a branch; no Cargo clean is needed.

The launcher reuses the existing badge design and generates an icon under the
ignored `src-tauri/target/dev-icons/` directory. The generated bytes determine its
filename, so changed labels, source artwork, or rendering update Tauri's embedded
icon even with a warm build. Generation requires macOS Swift/AppKit and `iconutil`;
if it fails, startup warns and continues with the ordinary icon. Explicit Tauri
`--config` arguments still take precedence over the generated icon and port.

Ordinary checkouts, non-macOS launches, and `pnpm tauri build` keep their existing
icons. This does not change the app identifier, credentials, profiles, or
notification settings.

## Shared logic and host boundaries

Browser and desktop share the React application, community sessions, durable
outbox, protocol models and live scheduler. **The goal is one code path per feature
in development and release:** desktop development uses the same shared frontend
and Rust host as packaged desktop, not a Node implementation of the feature.
`browser-host/` supplies browser-development host support and broker tests, not a second
owner of feature logic. **Preserve supported browser capabilities:** reduce
duplicate implementations, not available workflows. Reuse shared feature owners
rather than add parallel Node feature logic; native-only capabilities do not
require speculative browser parity. Develop and test those with
`BUZZ_DEV_VIEWER= just desktop`. Node code does not run in a browser merely because
it serves one, and packaged desktop has no Node backend.

| Mode | Identity and relay host |
| --- | --- |
| `just web`, public `BUZZ_DEV_VIEWER` pin | Node broker using the pinned existing legacy identity (macOS/Linux) |
| `just web`, no pin | Shell/fixtures; no live broker identity |
| `just desktop`, public pin | Legacy broker identity/relay access inside the native window; native identity is disabled (not an acceptance mode) |
| `just desktop`, no pin | Native identity/relay access on supported macOS, Windows and Linux |
| Packaged desktop | Native host; production builds exclude the dev broker regardless of the pin |

A static frontend build does not supply a standalone browser login/backend.
The public pin does not migrate keys. Native debug worktrees share a credential
namespace distinct from release and legacy broker credentials; ports and plugin
profiles do not isolate those keys. Removing the pin may change the active
identity, not just the transport. Do not change defaults, credentials or a running
app as incidental cleanup. See [identity custody and acceptance](identity.md).

### Where behavior belongs

- Put platform-neutral models, edits and protocol policy in their existing
  `src/features/*` owner, with current callers rather than speculative adapter
  parity. The Node host and native frontend adapter can reuse dependency-free
  TypeScript where appropriate;
  [sidebar edits](../src/features/relay/sidebar-edits.ts) and
  [community commands](../src/features/communities/admin-protocol.ts) are examples.
  Shared modules must not depend on Node, Tauri or a dev-host implementation.
- Keep signing keys, decryption, secure storage, subprocesses and host I/O in the
  host. Shipped Rust IPC boundaries retain their own validation, signing policy,
  destination/identity binding, resource limits, cancellation and lifecycle
  ownership. Moving checks into shared frontend code is not a substitute for Rust
  enforcement. The relay remains the access-control authority. Existing broker
  endpoints keep their safety checks while they remain callable; this does not
  require a Node endpoint or signing-policy copy for a new feature.
- **Frontend TypeScript checks + Rust enforcement:** both ship. Shared concrete
  contract cases are the long-term pattern for necessary cross-language logic,
  not a universal adapter or code generator. Existing JSON fixtures can be read by
  Vitest and Rust `include_str!`.
- **Node browser host + Rust native host:** only Rust ships in packaged desktop,
  but browser workflows still need host support. Share application policy where
  practical; retain necessary host enforcement and I/O. Shared cases check drift
  wherever both hosts implement the same contract, without requiring automatic
  parity. Document intentional or unresolved differences with separate expected
  outcomes; neither implementation automatically defines intended policy.
  Changing outcomes is a behavior decision, not a refactor. Do not add a second
  source of feature policy in `browser-host/`.

### Review and evidence

A cross-host change names its feature owner/current consumers, supported modes,
behavior preserved or explicitly approved differences, and the duplicate code it
removes. Update the feature's contract cases and relevant wiring tests in the
same change. Reuse existing runners and CI; this is not an extra full-suite gate
for each edit. Keep feature details with their owner, not copied into this guide.

[Canvas shape cases](../src/features/channel-templates/canvas-signing-contract.json)
check the existing Node/Rust contract for kind-40100 tag shape, including an
explicitly rejected native deserialization case; each host separately tests the
UTF-8 content limit. This is not whole endpoint parity: broker freshness checks,
native serialized-event limits, HTTP/IPC authorization and publication outcomes
are separate layers. Keep host-specific checks and regression coverage while the
corresponding boundary is callable, including after any adapter replacement.

**Manual testing of anything that ships uses `BUZZ_DEV_VIEWER= just desktop`.**
The explicit empty value overrides a pin inherited from `.env.local`; merely
unsetting the shell variable does not. This selects the shipped native code path,
not the release credential namespace or a release bundle. Packaging, OS integration
and release-specific behavior still need the appropriate packaged-build checks.
Broker-backed runs, including pinned native windows, do not count as acceptance.
They remain useful for browser diagnostics and existing broker tests, but do not
prove native signing, OS storage, networking or filesystem behavior.

Report the exact snapshot and host/mode exercised. Native/live acceptance needs an
agreed isolated identity/data setup; browser fixtures and test identities must
never use real keys. Do not launch a native app or switch someone's active identity
merely to follow this testing guidance.

### Broker consolidation and completion

The behavior-preserving cleanup pass shares status text/emoji limits, DM
participant-set policy, and sidebar intent rules with their existing
`src/features/relay` owners. The broker still executes those checks host-side and
retains its stricter untrusted-envelope checks; native Rust enforcement is
unchanged. Status reads still validate raw text before trimming, while local edits
trim first. Star and mute commands share one broker implementation in
`sidebar-toggle.mjs`; their distinct absent-unstar/unmute behavior stays in the
shared edit owner. This does not make broker and native signing policies identical.

There is no follow-up retirement queue. Further consolidation needs a demonstrated
duplicate responsibility, a current shared owner or justified replacement, and
preserved browser and native behavior. Necessary host-specific enforcement and
I/O are not duplication to remove merely because two hosts implement them.

A broker endpoint/module can be removed only after a replacement preserves its
supported browser workflow and custody guarantees, all callers move, and relevant
regression coverage follows. Native acceptance alone does not prove a browser
replacement works. Capability retirement is a separate explicit product decision,
not part of this cleanup; do not weaken a callable endpoint to reduce line count.

Developer tools live in `scripts/` (`developer-settings.ts`,
`live-setup-probe.mjs`), separate from `browser-host/`; they are not Rust feature
mirrors. Legacy library and hosted-community helpers (`agent-library.mjs`,
`builderlab.mjs`) are not automatically replaced by native identity. A transport
replacement or new backend needs a separate design decision. This cleanup changes
no runtime defaults or credentials.

## Interactive product iteration

While shaping the first version, default to **edit → human tries the running app
→ adjust**. A manual feedback handoff is not a review or shipping gate.

- Reuse the agreed development worktree and branch, with one owner of product
  edits. Keep one dev server running: `BUZZ_DEV_VIEWER= just desktop` for manual
  testing of shipped behavior. `just web` remains useful for browser-only
  diagnostics and fixtures, not acceptance. Vite handles supported frontend
  updates without a package rebuild. State when a reload/restart is needed;
  coordinate native launches with the human rather than restarting their app.
- Make small, coherent changes and hand them back as **ready to try**, naming
  what to exercise and which checks ran or remain deferred. Do not wait for E2E,
  native compilation, independent review, or a full build before each ordinary
  UI feedback round. Keep a short list of changed behaviors and deferred checks
  in task notes so the later validation pass has a bounded scope.
- Use editor/compiler feedback and cheap targeted checks where useful. Add
  focused regression tests with behavior, but do not make test-harness work a
  prerequisite for ordinary visual feedback. `just iterate` is an optional
  checkpoint, not a per-edit requirement: it installs, formats, type-checks and
  builds, rather than merely refreshing the app. Local checkpoint commits use
  the existing staged-file hook; no hook bypass is needed.
- When the human is happy with a coherent batch, finish its regression coverage,
  self-review, and obtain independent review where risk warrants. Let mandatory
  pre-commit/pre-push hooks own their checks; run focused behavior checks they do
  not cover and use existing CI for broad validation. Do not duplicate hook or
  CI suites locally by default. Run `just scan` only when explicitly requested or
  needed to reproduce a broad integration failure, not for every review,
  integration, or handoff. Attribute validation to the checked snapshot; later
  edits require appropriate revalidation. Before delivery, compare the branch's
  merge base with the fetched target branch: GitHub PR checks run the merged tree,
  which can include tests absent from the feature branch. Inspect incoming changes
  that overlap changed UI contracts (including accessible names), integrate them,
  and run the affected test files rather than assuming branch-only passes cover them.
  Shared access-gating changes also affect standalone composer/reaction fixtures,
  broker filter models, and restored-navigation/unread journeys. Repair stale
  fixtures without loosening authority, then finish those journeys: an early mock
  failure can mask a later production lifecycle regression.
  Fix failures and rerun the affected gate rather than repeating unchanged successful
  work. **Validated** means the
  required checks passed, not merely that the screen looked right; pending CI
  and untested native/browser behavior remain explicit gaps.

### Performance is acceptance, not a follow-up

For changes that add startup/sidebar work, reads or channel switching, include a
short cold/warm check in the feedback round. Correctness-only passes do not
establish that opening stayed fast. Optional names, avatars and speculative work
must yield to opening/reading a conversation; keep relay admission and access
checks intact. A failed read must expose retry rather than leave a false spinner.

Use the focused [channel-opening contract](browser-testing.md#channel-opening-performance)
when changing that path; do not add the entire browser suite to each UI edit.
Record click-to-visible time separately for cold and warm states, and split cold
waiting into reader queue, broker admission, network and verification/render work.
Compare equivalent cache/connection states. After the human is satisfied, include
these regressions in the ordinary batch gate. Do not raise a budget just to make a
regression green; explain the changed work and obtain agreement.

Exceptions: check safety-critical changes (auth/signing, persistence/migrations,
protocol semantics, or destructive writes) before exercising those paths against
real data. State the risk and required check up front. Native, dependency and
build-configuration changes still warrant broad validation; `FOUNDATION` edits
still require explicit human guidance. Defer expensive validation during ordinary
product iteration, not safety or the final quality gate. Do not turn `iterate`
into an ever-growing full test suite.

## Git hooks

### Pre-commit checks

`lefthook.yml` declares ordinary `pre-commit` and `pre-push` hooks. On a machine
with [lhm](https://github.com/block/lhm) there is nothing to install: lhm's global
hooks discover this file and merge it with the machine policy each time a hook
runs; `lhm dry-run` from the repository root prints the merged result. Without
lhm, install once per clone (linked worktrees share the installed hooks):

```sh
just hooks # or bin/just hooks without Hermit activation
```

Existing standalone clones must rerun `just hooks` once after pulling this change
to replace old shims; their old stock runner cannot self-update past the version
gate. Do this in every clone, not every linked worktree.

This recipe runs the pinned `bin/lefthook install`; it never changes Git config.
If installation refuses because of a global `core.hooksPath`, **do not follow
Lefthook's suggested fixes**: `--reset-hooks-path` and
`git config --unset-all --global core.hooksPath` can disable machine hooks in
other repositories. Running `lefthook install --force` **without first setting a
clone-local path** can replace hooks in the global directory, affecting every
repository that uses it. Under lhm, install nothing.

For a **non-lhm** global path, if you explicitly want this clone to use its own
hooks instead, first remove any stale worktree-local overrides as described
below. Then set the clone-local path before running `--force`, from either
checkout:

```sh
git config --local core.hooksPath "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)/hooks"
bin/lefthook install --force
```

The absolute path works in the main checkout and linked worktrees; the global
setting is unchanged, but its hooks no longer run in this clone. Do not use this
override for lhm.

The installed hooks fail rather than silently skip when they cannot find
Lefthook; `bin/lefthook uninstall` removes them. The repository pins a temporary
patched runner, `2.1.18-buzz.3`, to fix concurrent linked-worktree recovery.
Standalone shims select `bin/lefthook`. **Under lhm, activate Hermit before
committing or pushing** (`source bin/activate-hermit`), since lhm selects
`lefthook` from `PATH` and does not read the repo's `lefthook:` setting. A
nonactivated GUI/agent shell using stock 2.1.17 or older is rejected by
`min_version` before any unstaged edits are hidden. **If no Lefthook exists on
PATH, lhm 0.14.1 can silently skip hooks instead** (especially in linked worktrees);
the repository config cannot prevent that fallback. Use Git from an activated
shell, or a client that actually inherits that shell’s environment, and verify
`command -v lefthook` resolves to this checkout’s `bin/lefthook`. Do not bypass
hooks or change machine policy. Upgrading Homebrew's stock runner is not this fix.

This version gate is temporary, not a capability check: future stock 2.1.18+
would pass it. Reassess the gate at the next upstream release and adopt only a
release verified to preserve the recovery guarantees. Source, license,
revalidation commands, and removal criteria are in
[`bin/packages/lefthook-recovery.md`](../bin/packages/lefthook-recovery.md).

Pre-commit runs these jobs in order and stops at the first failure: refuse staged
names containing `*`, `?`, `[` or `\`, which Git would expand as globs when
Lefthook restages them; the staged icon policy (known alternate icon families,
direct upstream imports outside the design-system gateway, whole-catalog
imports); pinned Biome formatting and safe lint fixes on staged JS/TS/JSON/CSS;
and rustfmt on staged Rust files. Remaining warnings/errors block the commit; no
unsafe lint fixes are applied. Deletions and unsupported formats (including
Markdown, HTML and YAML) are not formatted here. The hook does **not** run types,
tests, builds, Clippy, or a whole-tree formatter. `just iterate` remains the
optional whole-tree fix/build command; `just scan` is an opt-in broad diagnostic.
Both reject remaining Biome warnings.

Lefthook owns partial staging: it hides the unstaged hunks of partially staged
files while the jobs run, restages the formatted files, then restores the hunks,
so unstaged hunks never enter the commit. The patched runner isolates patches
per worktree and uses owned `refs/lefthook/backup/<hash>` recovery refs instead
of modifying the shared stash list. A failed restore retains the backup:
`git for-each-ref refs/lefthook/backup/` lists them; preserve current edits, then
use `git stash apply --index <ref>` in a clean worktree at the original base.
After verifying recovery, delete only that ref with
`git update-ref -d <ref> <hash>`. Legacy stashes remain untouched; recovery refs
are not automatically expired and can be included by `git push --mirror`.
When a formatter changes the same lines
as an unstaged hunk, the commit is blocked with "conflict while merging unstaged
changes" and the index, the files and unrelated edits are left as they were;
format the file first (`just iterate` or the editor), then reselect your hunks.
A failing read-only check leaves the index untouched; a failing formatter stages
nothing of its own, while an earlier formatter's restage stands. rustfmt follows
`mod` declarations into the working tree like `cargo fmt --all`; only staged
files are restaged. Do not edit or stage concurrently with a commit. This is a
developer guardrail, not a security boundary or a substitute for CI and
risk-appropriate behavior checks. Tool/config dependency changes require
relevant integration evidence, not an automatic local full scan.

### Machine policy under lhm

lhm runs the repository jobs first, then the machine's commands in the same hook:
`sadscan` after the pre-commit jobs and `check-push-org` after the push lanes. A
policy rejection still blocks the push, after the project checks have run. The
machine policy skips pre-commit during merges and rebases; CI remains the gate.

Checkouts set up by the previous Buzz installer carry a worktree-local
`core.hooksPath` that now points at deleted files, so Git either runs no hooks
there or fails every commit. In each such worktree run
`git config --worktree --unset core.hooksPath` and leave
`extensions.worktreeConfig` set.

Verify the wiring with:

```sh
git config --show-origin --get core.hooksPath # lhm's hooks directory, or unset
bin/node --test tests/integration/hooks.test.mjs
# Optional bounded probe, with isolated lhm system/user configuration:
BUZZ_REAL_LHM="$(command -v lhm)" bin/node --test --test-name-pattern='real lhm' tests/integration/hooks.test.mjs
```

For human acceptance, in a disposable checkout: commit a fully staged unformatted
source file and confirm it lands formatted; stage half of a file and confirm only
the staged hunks are committed with `git stash list` unchanged; introduce a Biome
warning and confirm the commit is blocked with the index unchanged. Automated
probes do not replace this confirmation before PR readiness.

### Fast pre-push feedback

Pre-push runs the project TypeScript check (`tsc --noEmit`), then Vitest tests
related to the branch's changed JS/TS inputs, using the locally available merge
base with `origin/main`. Documentation-only, native-only and Rust-only pushes
skip this runner. Shared JS configuration/dependency
changes, source deletions, or a missing base run the full Vitest suite instead.
The selector explicitly includes theme tests for their directly read CSS/bootstrap
inputs, and the app composition test for source edits that its Vite loader hides
from the import graph.
A separate **design-system** job runs `design:typecheck` and `design:check` after
types/unit tests. A separate **rust-clippy** job runs the pinned Clippy over the
whole Cargo workspace with the same invocation as the `native` CI lane
(`cargo clippy --workspace --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings`); Rust-only
changes do not run the JS/test lane, and its first cold build can take minutes.
The jobs are serialized because Lefthook shares a mutable stdin reader between
jobs: parallel consumers can lose Git refs and silently skip checks. Source CSS/JS/TS, design viewer/guard files, shared
configuration/dependencies and hook-runner changes select this job; a missing base
runs it conservatively. Its selection is independent of the unit-test skip, so
CSS-only and viewer-only errors still block a push. The Clippy lane is likewise
selected independently: Rust source (`crates/`, `src-tauri/`), the workspace
manifests/lockfile, Clippy or Rust toolchain configuration, and changes under
`bin/` (the pinned toolchain) select it. Documentation-only pushes skip all
three jobs. Every selected job must pass.
On a busy machine, set `BUZZ_TEST_WORKERS=2 git push` to limit Vitest worker
concurrency in the hook. The optional value must be a positive integer; leaving
it unset preserves Vitest's default. This also applies to direct Vitest runs and
does not change test selection, timeouts, assertions, or retries.

Neither the JS nor design job fetches, installs dependencies, formats, or starts
browsers; the design job disables pnpm dependency auto-repair. The Clippy job
runs no builds beyond Clippy's own check pipeline, no tests and no browsers;
its first cold run downloads dependencies and can take minutes. Install
dependencies when switching branches, not during a push.

This is advisory coverage of the current working tree, not a replacement for CI:
uncommitted edits can affect results, dynamic dependencies may not be selected,
and non-HEAD refs are explicitly left to CI. Type errors, design violations, test
failures and Clippy warnings block the push. The type checks use `tsconfig.json` and
`tsconfig.design.json`; they do not typecheck plain JavaScript browser tests or
prove runtime service provisioning.
Do not edit files concurrently with hooks. First-use Hermit tool downloads can
add setup time; normal warm hooks use the pinned tools already installed.

## Pull-request CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every PR and push to `main`, without path filters
that could omit newly added tests. It splits the CI-selected `scan` coverage
across cached, parallel jobs rather than running the entire recipe several times.
[Three documented WebKit cases remain local-only](browser-testing.md#ci-coverage-and-local-only-webkit-checks);
the complete suite still runs with `pnpm test` / `just scan`:

- **JavaScript:** two runners, each with Biome, one TypeScript check and a frontend
  build. Vitest splits all test files across the runners, with two workers each;
  both shards must succeed. Timing artifacts include the shard number.
- **Rust and tool integration:** workspace formatting, Clippy, all Rust tests and
  doctests (including Tauri), and every Node integration test. The CLI integration
  tests build Rust and install scaffold dependencies; they are intentionally CI-only
  rather than part of pre-push.
- **Browser measurements:** Chromium then WebKit, serially on an isolated runner.
- **Browser journeys:** twelve runners (Chromium and WebKit, six file-level shards
  per engine), each with two workers. They start alongside measurements on separate
  runners; `CI required` still requires both lanes. A separate required Ubuntu
  job builds the native plugin-manager fixture once with Hermit's pinned Cargo.
  It uploads a tar with executable permission, checkout revision and SHA-256
  checksum; shards download by exact same-run artifact ID and verify all three
  before running. A missing artifact fails CI rather than rebuilding. Local
  non-CI journeys retain the locked Cargo build. Each browser test uses its own
  mutable fixture home. No measurements are repeated on shards and no retries
  hide failures.
- Both browser lanes use the version-matched, digest-pinned
  [Playwright Docker image](https://playwright.dev/docs/docker), which supplies
  browsers and Linux libraries without per-job apt provisioning. Follow the
  [CI container guidance](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci#via-containers).
  Update both image references and digests when upgrading `@playwright/test`.
  Setup verifies installed Playwright against image metadata and launches the
  selected engine (both for measurements) before tests; it never downloads a
  missing browser. Hermit pins Node/pnpm through explicit `./bin/` entry points
  and fails closed if the pnpm store path cannot be resolved. Containers use
  `HOME=/root` and trust only their exact checked-out workspace. Native host
  jobs keep their normal toolchain and library setup.
- **CI required:** fails unless every automatic Linux lane and every browser shard succeeds,
  including cancellation or an unexpectedly skipped lane. Configure this status
  as a required repository check; the workflow does not change branch protection.

Actions and tool versions are pinned, installs use the frozen lockfile, and
Hermit/pnpm/Cargo caches avoid repeat downloads and cold compilation.
Superseded PR runs are cancelled. Automatic CI uses disposable Ubuntu runners and no live
Buzz identity or signing credentials. It is not native GUI acceptance, a signed
package, or a cross-platform release gate. `just scan` remains available locally;
CI does not add full scans to commit/push or ordinary interactive feedback rounds.

### On-demand Windows validation

Automatic PR/main CI is Linux-only. Run the existing workflow manually for native
Windows changes or release validation:

```sh
gh workflow run ci.yml --ref <branch>
```

A manual dispatch runs only **Windows native validation**: the same pinned Rust,
Clippy and complete Tauri, agent-controller and credential-store package tests,
without repeating Linux/browser jobs.
Windows failures do not block the automatic `CI required` check; a Linux pass
is not Windows validation. The job does not exercise OS banner interaction or
packaged-app acceptance.

For MSVC, `src-tauri/build.rs` links `windows-app-manifest.xml` into both the app
and library unit-test executables. The XML matches Tauri's default Common Controls
v6 manifest; icons/version resources remain Tauri-owned. This addresses
[Tauri's library-test manifest gap](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/13419)
without disabling IPC tests or native UI features. Non-MSVC builds retain Tauri's
default resource path. Keep the manifest aligned when upgrading Tauri.

## Test organization

Keep component and service tests beside their owner, including integration tests
that belong to one subsystem. Use Vitest for these tests (`*.test.ts`,
`*.test.tsx`, or existing `*.test.mjs`); JavaScript tests do not need a TypeScript
rewrite just to move. `vitest.config.ts` discovers tests under `src/`,
`browser-host/` and `scripts/`. Tooling tests stay beside their scripts.

- `src/app/pages.integration.test.mjs` exercises the actual bundled app composition;
  `src/plugins/runtime.test.mjs` covers plugin activation and disposal.
- `browser-host/relay-broker.test.mjs` lives beside the Node-only development broker. Other
  broker integration tests remain with the community/relay behavior they exercise.
- `tests/integration/` is for cross-system journeys. The plugin CLI test keeps
  Node's runner because it builds the Rust CLI, scaffolds a separate project, runs
  its build and installs the resulting module.
- `tests/browser/` contains the automated whole-app Chromium/WebKit journeys.
- Rust integration tests stay under their owning crate's `tests/` directory.

`pnpm test` runs all four layers: Node integration, Vitest, Rust plugin-manager,
then Playwright. Updating a test's location must also update discovery, imports,
fixture URLs and root-path calculations; moving a file must not silently drop it
from the gate.

### Choosing a test layer

Choose the cheapest layer that can observe the failure, not the tool used by the
last test in the feature. Regression coverage is about behavior, not test counts
or a coverage percentage. These rules apply to human and AI contributions alike.

| Contract | Default layer |
| --- | --- |
| Parsing, policy, state machines, protocol handling, service coordination | Vitest in Node; use real collaborating services where the boundary matters |
| Component state, effects, subscriptions, forms, semantic DOM and stale async results | React Testing Library in Vitest with jsdom |
| Layout, virtualization, scrolling, native editing/focus interactions, real browser storage coordination | Playwright in both engines |
| App composition across routing, plugins, transport and persistence | Representative Playwright journeys, with permutations in lower layers |

Run JS tests with `bin/pnpm exec vitest run`, optionally followed by a test path.
For mounted component tests, add `// @vitest-environment jsdom` at the top of the
colocated test and import `@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest` for DOM assertions.
Use real React (including StrictMode), role/label queries and `userEvent` for
interactions. Use `fireEvent` for deliberately low-level events or bulk input
whose keystrokes are not the contract. Unmount with RTL `cleanup` in `afterEach`;
clear owned storage and restore spies. Fake external services, not React hooks.
Keep snapshots stable until a service actually changes, and assert cleanup and
late-result rejection through real mounting, rerendering and unmounting.
See the [composer tests](../src/features/messages/MessageComposer.test.tsx).

jsdom is the default DOM emulator, not a second browser gate. Its
[standards-oriented implementation](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom#readme) and
compatibility with Testing Library favor behavioral fidelity over emulator-only
speed claims. [Vitest supports Happy DOM too](https://vitest.dev/guide/environment),
but introducing another emulator requires a demonstrated benefit on our actual
component tests without per-environment workarounds. Neither proves rendering,
native IME behavior or browser performance. Keep layout shims local and explicit;
do not treat synthetic dimensions as acceptance evidence.

Before accepting test changes, reviewers should verify:

- Each added browser case identifies a browser-specific behavior or integration
  boundary that a lower layer cannot establish. Keep failure/recovery coverage,
  but avoid repeating the same state matrix through full app startup.
- A moved assertion has a named replacement and evidence that a plausible defect
  makes it fail. Similar test titles do not establish equivalent coverage.
- Fixture data matches the test's needs. Share stateless servers/compiled assets,
  not browser contexts or mutable state; keep scale tests representative.
- Timing claims distinguish setup, execution, runner/engine and the checked
  snapshot. Report added/removed cases and deferred checks. Do not impose a
  flaky wall-clock threshold on ordinary correctness tests.

Follow `AGENTS.md` to record those decisions in the PR description and enforce
them during agent review. Request a lower-layer test when the browser justification
is missing, rather than accept unbounded journey growth. Existing broad fixtures and hook-mocked tests are
migration work, not patterns for new tests; convert them by owner without
bundling unrelated product changes.

### Manual browser fixtures

With `just web` running **without a `BUZZ_DEV_VIEWER` pin**, these separate diagnostic pages
use fixture identities/transports rather than the live broker:

| URL | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/tests/fixtures/communities.html` | Local profile and join dialog; first profile publication deliberately rejected |
| `/tests/fixtures/relay-composer.html` (optional `?durable`) | Delayed signing/publication and one-time rejection for messages containing `reject` |
| `/tests/fixtures/relay-storage.html` | Real IndexedDB migration, signed restore, deletion and partition isolation |
| `/tests/fixtures/relay-startup.html` | Cold/warm send timings with 512 retained signed records |

These pages are manual diagnostics, **not automatically run by `pnpm test`**.
The scrolling gate does not replace their checks. Use a disposable browser profile
for their local storage; timings are diagnostics, not production guarantees.

## Foundation files

The standard source comment is `FOUNDATION: <responsibility and constraint>`.
Agent instructions for these files live in `AGENTS.md`: edits require explicit
human guidance, and foundation files have stricter code review standards.
