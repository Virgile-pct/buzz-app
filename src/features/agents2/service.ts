// Agents2: agents that are plugins from the start. A plugin registers an agent
// type (its summary line, peek view, settings tabs and `run`); each agent made
// from it has its own native-held key, an `agent-attention/v1` configuration the
// app owns and edits, and a config blob the type owns. The app delivers matching live events to
// `run` from the stream the owner already receives in the agent's community,
// selected or not, so no plugin opens a socket or a REQ.
